 The aim of Sloth Mail is to provide users with a free and easy to use form of communicating. We believe that  

##How to use
In order to use this app, run main.py. If issues arise, run the following pytho files prior to running main.py: init.py auth.py models.py views.py.
init.py Makes the website folder a python package meaning we can import the website package and whatever is inside init.py is ran automatically. auth.py and models.py are for database models. views.py Stores main views aka url end points for the front-end of the website.

Technology used to create Sloth Mail: Flask Python framework allowing us to build simple websites, Flask-sqlalchemy SQL toolkit for python allowing us to interact with databases so we can use high-level objects instead of writing SQL queries directly. Jinja, which is a templating engine that generates HTML templates that are then rendered by the web server and sent to the client's broswer. 

This app is very straightfoward. Users can create an account and customize their profiles. The main objective of this app is for users to send and receieve messages from other users. They are also able to create itemized to-do lists where they can mark tasks as completed.
