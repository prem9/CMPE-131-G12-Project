To run this application run main.py If issues arise, run: init.py auth.py models.py views.py before running main.py

Explanation: init.py Makes the website folder a python package meaning we can import the website package and whatever is inside init.py is ran automatically auth.py models.py Used for database models views.py Stores main views aka url end points for the front-end of the website

Technology used: Flask Python framework allowing us to build simple websites Flask-sqlalchemy SQL toolkit for python allowing us to interact with databases Can use high-level objects instead of writing SQL queries directly Jinja A templating engine that generates HTML templates that are then rendered by the web server and sent to the client's broswer

Examples of use: This app is very straightfoward. Users can create an account and customize their profiles. The main objective of this app is for users to send and receieve messages from other users. They are also able to create itemized to-do lists where they can mark tasks as completed.
